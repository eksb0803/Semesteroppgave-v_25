            <h1>About the Museum</h1>
            <p>
                The Community Science Center is a vibrant museum dedicated to making science accessible, exciting, and engaging for people of all ages. Founded over 50 years ago, the museum has grown into a place where curiosity meets discovery through interactive exhibits, educational programs, and community events.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to inspire the next generation of scientists, researchers, and explorers by providing hands-on learning experiences and fostering a deeper understanding of the natural world and the wonders of science.
            </p>
